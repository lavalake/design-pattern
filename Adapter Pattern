http://wiki.c2.com/?AdapterPattern
The AdapterPattern lets classes with incompatible interfaces work together. This is sometimes called a wrapper because an 
adapter class wraps the implementation of another class in the desired interface. This pattern makes heavy use of 
delegation where the delegator is the adapter (or wrapper) and the delegate is the class being adapted.
Its principal feature is that it provides a way for an object to permit access to its internals in such a way that clients are 
not coupled to the structure of those internals
